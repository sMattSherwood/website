            <p>On my free time I like to travel wither it’s to a new city or a new hiking trail. During the summer I use, my road 
                bike to explore Kingston, and visit all the great restaurants downtown.In the future I would love to go to Europe, 
                and Asia to see and experience their amazing cultures they can offer.</p>
            <p>After a long day at the office, I like to go to the gym do some cardio, and lift weights to get my mind off bugs or any issues
                I’m experience developing software. I’ve been working out since I was in high school, and it’s always been an outlet for 
                any execs energy I have during the day. To be a good software engineer both mind and body should be well defined.</p>
            <p>I fist played James Bond on the N64 at my aunt’s house, and ever since then I’ve been hooked to gaming. 
                I like to emulate older games in my free time, and from a young age this gave me an interest in technology
                 and programming. To this day I always try to have fun in a virtual world even when I get busy with life.</p>
