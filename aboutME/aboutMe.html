       My name is Matthew Sherwood I am 21 years old this is my fourth year studying at St lawrence Collage.
       Durring my years in high school I started to get intrested in computers and creating programs to do complex
       operations as well as macking funny applications that satisfied my creative energy. Durring my first couple of years
       Coding I was getting used to how to adjust to collage from highschool and become a better developer, there have been 
       many hurtles and doubts along my jorney, but I have perserviered through my obsticles and have become a better developer
       and person in my jorney.
